Although it doesn't host the beautiful natural landscapes and beaches which Philippines is known for, this location gives a multicultural experience from lavish shopping malls, to historical parks, and to exotic street food that reflects that Philippine culture. Filipinos from the different provinces and even foreigners flock to Metro Manila to find leisure, recreational activities, education, work and many more. With the constant influx of population, no wonder this area has been bustling with different business opportunities, and one of which is the real estate business. The demand for housing has been increasing every year and for many real estate developers, the question in mind is \"where do we develop our next project?\" "
